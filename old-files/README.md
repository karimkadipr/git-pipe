# git-republish

This repository contain different tools or scripts that help with git flow and git repo management! And republishing!

## re-publish

For now there is a bash script that help with pushing to remote !! (re-publish)

## re-commit

And also there is a script for commits (re-commit).

This last one. With it, you can spicify a range for commits! And they will be commited again as fresh in another repo! One by one! Just like the work was done directly in the new repo! One by one! (The time however will be the time of the commiting)! So basically they will be all comitted at once! (as the principle is to get all commits! Then all changed files within each commit! And copy or remove! Depending on it! And commit with the same messages!

(This script isn't finished yet) (managed getting commits and getting a commit files)

left :
- check for when a file is deleted
- And commiting on the other repo and pushing
